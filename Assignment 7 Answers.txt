Assignment 7 Answers:
1. A

2.  Which class has the fewest subclass Exception/RuntimeException/Error and why?
A) Error class has fewer subclasses. Because error is considered as severe type of exception which we cannot catch and handle due to which fewer subclasses being created.

3.  Throwable is a class or Interface? Explain why?
A) Throwable is a class and not an interface and it is extended by all its subclasses like exception/runtimeexception/error. Throwable has its methods implementations.

4. A,B,C,D - All these classes can be thrown

5.  Why the following code will not compile.    

public static void test() throws FileNotFoundException {
	    	try {
	    		throw FileNotFoundException();
	    	}
	    	finally {
	    		
	    	}
	    }
A) The Above code would not compile because we are calling FileNotFoundException() as a method which is incorrect as its a class. we can use throw new FileNotFoundException() which would work.

7. Compare Error vs Exception?
Error is an unforeseen occurrence and are not checked which mean a severe problem had occured crashing the application
Errors cannot be catched and it haults the application. Errors usually indicate JVM or system Failures

Exception is a known error and is a condition where we can recover from. Exception can be checked by the compiler. Exceptions indicate unexpected conditions in application failure.

Examples of Exceptions include FileNotFoundException, IndexOutOfBoundsException, etc. Examples of Errors include OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError, NoClassDefFoundError, etc.

8. Compare Checked Exception vs Unchecked Exception? Give an example of Checked Exception. 
Checked Exception can be caught during the compile time but unchecked exception can be caught only on runtime.
Checked exceptions must be caught or specified in method declarations, unchecked exceptions do not need to be.
Checked exceptions indicate conditions that are valid for a developer to recover from, unchecked exceptions indicate logical errors that developers usually did not anticipate.

Examples of checked exception: FileNotFoundException, SQLException, IllegalArgumentException, etc.
